# American States Guessing Game

## Overview

This is a Python-based guessing game that allows users to test their knowledge of the US states. The game uses the Turtle graphics library to display a map of the United States, and prompts users to enter the name of a state. If the user correctly guesses the name of a state, the name will be displayed on the map and the user will receive points. The game also uses the Pandas library to load a CSV file of US state names, which is used to check the user's guesses.

## Installation

To install and run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/farukbeygo/US_state_guess`
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install pandas turtle`
3. Run the game: `python main.py`

## Usage

Once the game is running, follow these steps to play:

1. Look at the map of the United States displayed on the screen.
2. Enter the name of a state in the prompt window and press Enter.
3. If your guess is correct, the name of the state will be displayed on the map and you will receive points.
4. If your guess is incorrect your mistake chance will decrease, and the prompt window will display again.

The game will continue until you have correctly guessed all 50 US states, or your  mistake chance runned out.
